                  HelmReleaseUninstall, when true, indicates that these resources are
                  part of a Helm release uninstallation process.
                  This can be used to trigger specific cleanup or post-uninstall hooks.

                  is the final bundle in the sequence for the associated Helm release.
                  This can be used to trigger finalization steps, such as marking the

                  with other configurations and will not be automatically removed when the
                  ConfigurationGroup is deleted. This is intended for resources like
                  Sveltos CRDs or the agents Sveltos deploys in the managed clusters.
